# Fine-Tuning LLaMA-3.2 Instruct with QLoRA

## Description
This repository contains a notebook for fine-tuning the `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct` model using QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). The notebook demonstrates how to leverage low-rank adaptation techniques to fine-tune a large language model efficiently. The fine-tuning task uses the SST2 dataset for sentiment classification.

## Setup
