# Fine-Tuning LLaMA-3.2 Instruct with QLoRA

## Description
This repository contains a notebook for fine-tuning the `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct` (or other generative langauge models) model using Quantized LoRA (QLoRA) for sentiment classification on the Arabic HARD dataset. The method allows efficient adaptation of large language models for specific tasks using low-rank approximations, reducing memory requirements and computational overhead.
